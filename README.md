## Training

You will also need to

1) Download/Prepare SBD dataset (http://home.bharathh.info/pubs/codes/SBD/download.html).
2) Download pre-trained ResNet50 from pytorch model zoo.


```shell 
cd BriNet

# if you want to use default setting
python train.py -fold=0

# if you want to use default setting
python train.py -fold=0 -input_size=[353,353] -gpu=0 -checkpoint_dir='./checkpoint'
```

## Testing

Download trained models or load your trained model (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Om--IWIP0dZUx1ckEYhZS8utu5sZRvu6/view?usp=sharing). We assume you have downloaded the repository into ./checkpoint path.

```shell 
cd BriNet

# if you want to use default setting
python test.py -fold=0

# if you want to use default setting
python test.py -fold=0 -input_size=[353,353] -gpu=0 -checkpoint_dir='./checkpoint'
```
